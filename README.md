## Hello World üåç

I'm Anthoni Rivera from Per√∫, a Frontend Developer, Mobile UI & UX Designer. I enjoy every time I learn a new language and frameworks, like AngularJS, Ionic, as well as work in Wordpress.
I also enjoy making new mobile ui concepts, making friendlier prototipes. Sometimes I upload tech videos on Youtube(Spanish) https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC60PscAr7lALdtMx-YovY3g.
